# Perceptron Phishing Project

This project measures the performance of 5 different perceptron models in classifying phishing email scams. Perceptron.ipynb creates the abstract Perceptron class and its 5 subclasses. PhishingScript.ipynb retrieves the dataset from its url, enters it into a numPy array, divides into train and test sets, and performs the classification.
